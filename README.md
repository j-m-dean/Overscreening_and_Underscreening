## Summary
This repository contains all the time-averaged distributions of every kinetic Monte Carlo simulation conducted for the paper, and all the analysis required to make the figures for the paper. In addition, corner plots for each parameter set and all values of evidence and Bayes factors are provided.
To run the complete data analysis, run the following commands from the kmc_paper_data directory:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
snakemake clear
snakemake --cores all
```
Note however, that depending on the number of cores devoted to calculating the analysis, this could take anywhere between several hours and a day.

## Data processing workflow
Data processing is mostly managed using [`snakemake`](https://snakemake.readthedocs.io), and uses the scripts in the `kmc_paper_data` directory. The full data analysis workflow can be rerun with:
```
snakemake --cores all clear
snakemake --cores all
```
